# Klick: A Social Media App

This project is a full-stack social media application built to explore and implement core concepts in Next.js and backend development. It serves as a hands-on demonstration of how to construct a robust, scalable, and performant web application using modern technologies.

### Key Features and Tools üõ†Ô∏è

This project showcases the implementation of several core social media features, with each achieved using a specific tool or architectural pattern.

  * **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login functionality is built using **NextAuth.js**. This popular library simplifies the authentication process by handling session management and supporting various providers, allowing for a focus on the core application logic.
  * **User Profiles & Post Management:** The application's data layer for managing user profiles, posts, and other content is handled by **Prisma**, a modern Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). It provides a type-safe and intuitive way to interact with the database, abstracting away raw SQL queries.
  * **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Time-consuming background tasks, such as image processing or sending notifications, are offloaded to a dedicated **worker process** using a Redis-backed message queue like **BullMQ**. This architecture keeps the main Next.js server responsive and ensures a smooth user experience.
  * **Fast Content Loading:** Posts and messages are cached in **Redis** to ensure lightning-fast loading times. By serving frequently accessed data directly from this in-memory store, the application significantly reduces the load on the primary database, leading to highly performant content delivery.
  * **Interactive UI:** The user interface is built with highly interactive **React components**, leveraging the power of Next.js's App Router for server-side rendering and efficient data fetching.

### Backend Concepts in Action üß†

This project provides insight into crucial backend and Next.js concepts. Here's a closer look at some of the key architectural decisions:

#### Workers Flow

The **worker process** is a fundamental concept for building scalable and robust applications. Here's how it's implemented in this project:

1.  **Job Creation:** When a user performs an action that requires a backend task (e.g., uploading a profile picture), the main Next.js API route simply adds a "job" to a queue.
2.  **Redis Queue:** This job, containing all the necessary information, is pushed into a queue powered by **Redis**. Redis acts as a message broker, holding a list of jobs to be processed.
3.  **Worker Consumption:** A separate, long-running Node.js process (the "worker") constantly polls this queue. When a new job is available, it pulls the job from the queue.
4.  **Asynchronous Processing:** The worker then performs the heavy lifting, such as resizing the image, in the background. This frees up the main web server to handle new user requests, preventing it from being blocked.

This pattern, often implemented with a library like BullMQ, ensures the application remains highly responsive and fault-tolerant.

#### Redis Caching for Fast Loading

Performance is a top priority for any social media application. Redis is used as an in-memory caching layer to achieve this.

  * **Cache-First Strategy:** When the application needs to retrieve data for posts or messages, it first checks the Redis cache.
  * **High-Speed Retrieval:** If the data is found in the cache, it's served immediately, providing an incredibly fast user experience.
  * **Database Fallback:** If the data is not in the cache, the application fetches it from the primary database (via Prisma), and then stores it in Redis for future requests, ensuring that subsequent loads of the same data are fast.

This caching strategy dramatically reduces the number of expensive database queries, leading to better scalability and performance under high traffic.

### Getting Started üöÄ

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shubthenub/klick.git
    cd klick
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn, pnpm, bun
    ```

3.  **Set up the environment:**
    Create a `.env` file based on a `.env.example` (if available) and configure your database and authentication credentials.

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev, pnpm dev, bun dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Future Enhancements and Reflection

This project has been an invaluable part of the journey into full-stack development. It has allowed for a transition from frontend concepts to a more holistic understanding of application architecture, data flow, and backend logic. While there are still many more additions and bug fixes that can be done, the foundation for a robust social media app has been successfully laid.
